# Contracts (Foundry)

This repository uses Foundry for Solidity build/deploy.

The installer runs Foundry inside a container (`ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest`) so you do not need host tooling.

Dependencies:
- forge-std is fetched automatically by `forge install` during containerized build step.
