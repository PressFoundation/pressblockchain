# SYNC — MVP Features (production intent)

1) On-chain article submission page (fee + optional bond) -> pending until Oracle passes.
2) Oracle moderation gate (porn/graphic/illegal content flags) before WP publish.
3) Live vote bar UI (polls Articles API) with 72h auto-close.
4) Co-author support (PRESS fee): revenue split 50/50, rights control remains primary.
5) Outlet pool distributions: tips routed to outlet pool; split to members by activity.
6) Article NFTs: mint-on-approve; optional Source Secrecy Vault attachment.
7) Syndication licensing: one-click license offers priced in PRESS.
8) Treasury routing: protocol fee cut on every publish/vote/license; authors keep 100% article revenue (net of protocol cut).

Implementation is completed across services and will be fully wired in the plugin PHP in the next milestone.
