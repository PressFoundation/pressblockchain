# RC10 Notes

This release focuses on wiring the marketplace and monetization surfaces into the deployer + outlet flows.

Delivered:
- Marketplace module definition + installer toggle conventions
- Article monetization primitives (tips, splits, co-author policy) documented for implementation lock-in
- Explorer visibility requirements (events + indexed tables)

Next:
- RC11 will finalize yearly burn flywheel + source role economics.
