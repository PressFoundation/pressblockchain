# RC11 Notes

Focus:
- Yearly burn flywheel economics (module: burn_flywheel)
- Source role + revenue streams (module: source_role)
- Journalist Earnings Vault & PRESS-native payroll framing (module: earnings_vault)
- Dispute Filing Bonds economics (module: dispute_bonds)

This pass locks the **spec** and **installer toggles** so implementation cannot drift across subsequent hardening passes.
