# Exchange listing tiers

Press Exchange listing is tiered to balance:
- trust (anti-rug guarantees)
- network costs
- discovery (promotion + syndication)

## Tiers
- **Basic**: token exists, not listed publicly.
- **Pro**: listed + standard discovery + analytics.
- **Elite**: listed + boosted discovery + syndication + liquidity routing rails.

Tier is selected at token deployment time and can be upgraded later via on-chain PRESS payment.
